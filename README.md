## Using Snowflake Intelligence

### Best Practices

1. **Start with broad questions** then drill down
   - _"Show me our loan portfolio"_ ‚Üí _"Focus on auto loans"_ ‚Üí _"Show trends over time"_

2. **Specify time periods** for accurate results
   - Use "last 30 days", "Q3 2024", "last 6 months", "year-over-year"

3. **Use business terms** the agent understands
   - "Certificate" or "CD" for certificates of deposit
   - "Encinitas branch" for branch-specific questions
   - "Credit utilization" for credit card usage
   - "Delinquent" for late payments

4. **Request visualizations** when appropriate
   - _"Show me a trend chart of auto loan balances"_
   - _"Create a bar chart of new members by channel"_

5. **Follow up questions** to explore deeper
   - _"Break that down by branch"_
   - _"How does that compare to last year?"_
   - _"Show me the members who fit that criteria"_

### Example Session Flow

```
You: "How many new members have we acquired in the last 90 days?"

Agent: "In the last 90 days, the credit union acquired 387 new members."

You: "Which branches had the most new members?"

Agent: "Top branches by new members (last 90 days):
1. Encinitas Main Branch: 97 members
2. San Diego Downtown: 58 members
3. Online Branch: 52 members
..."

You: "For Encinitas specifically, which marketing channels were most effective?"

Agent: "For Encinitas branch (last 90 days):
1. Referral: 29 members (30%)
2. Branch Walk-in: 24 members (25%)
3. Online: 19 members (20%)
..."

You: "Show me the trend of new member acquisition at Encinitas over the last 12 months."

Agent: [Returns monthly trend chart]
```

### Natural Language Flexibility

The agent understands many ways to ask the same question:
- _"How many new members last month?"_
- _"Show me member acquisition for the previous month"_
- _"How many people joined last month?"_
- _"What was new member growth in the last 30 days?"_

### Branch-Specific Questions

For Encinitas branch questions (or any branch):
- _"Show me certificates renewing at Encinitas"_
- _"How does Encinitas compare to other branches?"_
- _"What are the top performing branches?"_
- _"Rank branches by total deposits"_

## Customization Guide

### Adjusting the Data

**Modify Volumes:**
```sql
-- In 02_load_synthetic_data.sql, change ROWCOUNT
FROM TABLE(GENERATOR(ROWCOUNT => 5000))  -- Increase/decrease members
```

**Change Data Distributions:**
```sql
-- Adjust branch distribution percentages
WHEN 1 TO 25 THEN 'BR001'  -- Change from 25% to desired %
```

**Update Time Ranges:**
```sql
-- Modify date ranges for recency
DATEADD(day, -UNIFORM(90, 10950, RANDOM()), CURRENT_DATE())
-- Adjust min/max days back
```

### Extending the Schema

**Add New Product Type:**
1. Add loan type to LOANS table data generation
2. Add column to TIME_SERIES_METRICS_VIEW for trending
3. Update LOAN_PORTFOLIO_VIEW with new flags

**Add New Branch:**
1. Insert into BRANCHES table
2. Update member distribution logic
3. Re-load member data with new branch allocation

**Add New Metrics:**
1. Create calculated columns in semantic views
2. Update agent instructions with new terminology
3. Add sample questions for new metrics

### Modifying Agent Behavior

Edit `agent_instructions.md` to:
- Change agent personality or tone
- Add industry-specific terminology
- Include additional business rules
- Adjust credit score bands or risk categories
- Add new product definitions

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùå No data returned for time-based queries**
- Check date filters align with data range (last 24 months)
- Verify table has data: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM MEMBERS;`
- Ensure semantic views are created: `SHOW VIEWS;`

**‚ùå Branch-specific questions not working**
- Use exact branch name: `'Encinitas Main Branch'`
- Or use branch code: `BRANCH_CODE = 'ENC'`
- Check branch exists: `SELECT * FROM BRANCHES;`

**‚ùå Agent doesn't understand question**
- Be more specific with time periods ("last 30 days" not "recently")
- Use business terms from agent instructions
- Break complex questions into simpler parts

**‚ùå Credit card questions show no results**
- Verify using CREDIT_CARD_HEALTH_VIEW (not LOAN_PORTFOLIO_VIEW)
- Check loan type filter: `LOAN_TYPE = 'Credit Card'`
- Confirm credit cards exist: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM LOANS WHERE LOAN_TYPE = 'Credit Card';`

**‚ùå Trending queries are slow**
- Use TIME_SERIES_METRICS_VIEW (pre-aggregated)
- Add date filters to limit range
- Avoid joins; use the appropriate semantic view

### Data Verification Queries

```sql
-- Check row counts
SELECT 'MEMBERS' AS TABLE_NAME, COUNT(*) FROM MEMBERS
UNION ALL SELECT 'ACCOUNTS', COUNT(*) FROM ACCOUNTS
UNION ALL SELECT 'LOANS', COUNT(*) FROM LOANS;

-- Verify date ranges
SELECT 
    MIN(JOIN_DATE) as earliest_join,
    MAX(JOIN_DATE) as latest_join
FROM MEMBERS;

-- Check branch distribution
SELECT 
    BRANCH_NAME,
    COUNT(*) as member_count
FROM MEMBERS M
JOIN BRANCHES B ON M.PRIMARY_BRANCH_ID = B.BRANCH_ID
GROUP BY BRANCH_NAME
ORDER BY member_count DESC;

-- Verify semantic views
SELECT * FROM MEMBER_ACQUISITION_VIEW LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM CERTIFICATE_RENEWAL_VIEW WHERE IS_MATURING_90_DAYS = 1 LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM LOAN_PORTFOLIO_VIEW WHERE IS_AUTO_LOAN = 1 LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM CREDIT_CARD_HEALTH_VIEW LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM BRANCH_PERFORMANCE_VIEW;
SELECT * FROM TIME_SERIES_METRICS_VIEW ORDER BY METRIC_MONTH DESC LIMIT 12;
```
